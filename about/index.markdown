# About Me

I'm Johnson Page, a web (and software) developer from Brisbane, Australia. 

Currently, I'm working with [Locatrix Communications](http://locatrix.com), where I'm one of the lead engineers. We develop mobile apps, which focus around location and social services --- [Telstra's Whereis Everyone](http://everyone.whereis.com) is one of our most notable projects.

I'm responsible for writing quality code and making the design decisions that result in quality code too. I'm one of the main developers responsible for maintaining and extending our in-house, lightweight MVC framework.

I'm proficient in desiging webpages using __XHTML__, __JavaScript__ and __CSS__. Professionally, I often work with __PHP__, but reguarly dip my toes into the worlds of __Ruby__, __Python__ and __Java__ (for Android development). I publish my open-source code on [Github](http://github.com/jwpage).

When I'm not messing around with code I enjoy cooking, listening to music and the odd dose of science fiction.
