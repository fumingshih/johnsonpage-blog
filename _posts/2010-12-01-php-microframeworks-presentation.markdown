title: PHP Microframeworks Presentation
---
A week ago I delivered a short talk at the [Brisbane PHP Meetup](http://www.brisbanephp.net/) on PHP microframeworks (similar to [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com)), comparing how to implement a simple "Hello, `<name>`!" application in each one.

The frameworks covered include: [Slim](http://www.slimframework), [Limonade](http://www.limonade-php.net), [Fitzgerald](https://github.com/jim/fitzgerald), [Silex](http://github.com/fabpot/silex/) and [Lithium](http://rad-dev.org/lithium/). (Despite being a fully-fledged framework, Lithium is included as an example of how loosely-coupled components can be reused for simple tasks.)
