This is the first iteration of the new __johnsonpage.org__. In the coming days, I'll be updating this site with some new minor features and content.

What I can do right now, however, is give you a quick rundown on what this site's made up of:

* HTML 5, CSS, (and a minimal amount of) Javascript
* Blogging engine: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* CSS Framework: [Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/)

## What's Jekyll?

To quote the [the Jekyll README](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.textile):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.
