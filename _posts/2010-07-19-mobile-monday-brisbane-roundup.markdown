Last night, the Exchange Hotel hosted the [third Mobile Monday Brisbane meetup](http://www.mobilemondaybrisbane.com/2010/07/mobile-monday-brisbane-is-back/). There were maybe 30 attendants, and three speakers at the event: [@halfbrick](http://twitter.com/halfbrick), [@chriskettle](http://twitter.com/chriskettle) and [@oliverpalmer](http://twitter.com/oliverpalmer).

The first two talks centered around iPhone development and how to appropriately market to and communicate with the iPhone owners. Though I'm no longer trucking about with an iPhone, it certainly provided some handy tips and insights into the App Store marketplace.

In the third presentation, Oliver Palmer focused less on iPhones and apps, and instead opted to cover mobile as a "platform", and how it is growing in importance as mobile technology advances. There was even a mention of HTML5 and the mobile web, suggesting that the almighty app might not remain the choice for all mobile marketing.

The meeting was well organised with good speakers and a great new venue. My only note is that by holding the Mobile Monday on the third Monday of every month clashes with the existing [Brisbane Ruby meetup](http://www.meetup.com/brisbane-ruby-rails/) which means I'll probably have to choose which one to attend in the future!
